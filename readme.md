Hello there!

I am Ila, I began my Master's degree in Data Engineering and Analytics at Technical University of Munich in Winter Semester 2019-2020. 

Since I really love Open Source and helping my fellow peers, I am collecting all the material I generated during my studies. Course related notes and projects are organized in respective folders, while general files are in the main repository. 

The good news is, my LaTeX is objectively very pretty. The bad news is, my course choices are fairly unpopular, so do not expect mainstream machine learning stuff in this repository. The other half of my ECTS are Maths, and the notes for those are hand-written sheets of paper which have been used firstly to wipe my tears of desperation, and then gladly thrown away when the exam was over.

These are class notes and there is no assurance that the material is correct and compliant to the professors' standards, therefore use them at your own risk. If you have any problems or notice any errors, you are more than welcome to notify them to ilaria.battiston@gmail.com.

Of course I expect you to comply with the TUM Code of Conduct and not copy. Anyway, there is the license, so it is illegal to copy regardless if you care or not about TUM rules.

Pull requests are always welcome (especially for mainstream machine learning courses).
